# rpghelper
A Python-Flask project aiming to create a web-based helper application for playing tabletop RPGs. This basic version will be geared towards Cyberpunk RED.

## Features:

- **Account Management**: Players can create a new account and log in. GM (admin) can log in and manage created accounts.
- **Character Creation**: Players can create a game character. Each game character has basic health, armor class and icon. The GM can create NPC characters.
- **Character Management**: Each player can manage their own characters. Admin can manage all characters.
- **Game Map**: A basic game map to visualize a game scenario. Players can add and move their own game character around the map. The GM can add and move player & NPC characters and change the health/armor stats off all characters.
- **Game Notes**: Players can add public notes related to the game. The notes are displayed next to the map. The GM can create public and private notes to keep track of the game status.
